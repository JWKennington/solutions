#### Problem
Show that "angular momentum generates rotations" by using the below to compute the components of $[L_z]_{\{x, y, z\}}$
$$e^{-i\phi L_z} \equiv \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}(-i\phi L_z)^n$$
Conclude that the matrix represents a rotation.

#### Solution
To make this infinite sum more compact, begin by computing some of the first powers of $L_z$. You'll find that $L_z^3 = L_z$ and also note that $(iL_z)^5 = iL_z$. Let $A = e^{-I\phi L_z}$. Expand $A$ using the given formula for matrix exponentiation:
$$A = e^{-I\phi L_z} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \phi^n (-iL_z)^n$$
The right side of the previous expression may be split into two pieces, a sum of even powers of $iL_z$, $A_{even}$ and a sum of the odd powers, $A_{odd}$.

$$A_{even} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n/2}L_z^2\phi^n}{n!}$$
$$A_{odd} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}L_z\phi^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

These sums are more familiar, and nearly what we need to find a closed-form. Let's evaluate the components of the even and odd matrices to see what we get, recalling that our principal term $iL_z$ has the following components:
$$iL_z = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$
$$[A_{even}]_{11} = [A_{even}]_{22} = \cos\phi$$
$$[A_{odd}]_{12} = -[A_{even}]_{21} = \sin\phi$$
Using the above components, we can reassemble the matrix $A$ generated by $L_Z$ and observe that it is, in fact, a rotation:
$$A = A_{even} + A_{odd} = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\phi & \sin\phi & 0 \\
-\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$
If you're wondering why $A_{33}=1$, recall that by definition $A^0 = \mathbb{I}$.
