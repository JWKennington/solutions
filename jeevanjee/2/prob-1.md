#### Problem
For the below, determine if it is defined on all vector spaces, just those with non-degenerate Hermitian forms, or just those with an inner product.

1. Unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ for any $\mathbf{x}\in V$
2. Basis
3. Linear independence
4. Length or norm
5. Span
6. Orthogonality
7. Linear operator
8. Angle between two vectors $v$ and $w$ as defined by $\mathrm{cos}(\theta)=\frac{(v|w)}{\vert v\vert \vert w\vert}$
9. Dual space
10. Metric dual

#### Solution
For each of the below, $V$ means all vector spaces, $H$ means only those with non-degenerate Hermitian forms, 
and $P$ means only those with inner products:

1. $P$ - unit vector $\hat{x}$ requires the norm
1. $V$ - all vector spaces can have a basis (in fact, it is possible to prove that all vector spaces have a basis)
1. $V$ 
1. $P$ - norm requires positive-definite form, therefore inner products
1. $V$
1. $H$ - orthogonality 
1. $V$ - any vector space has a least the inclusion linear operator $\iota: V \xhookrightarrow{} V$ where $\iota(v) = v$ for all $v$ in $V$.
1. $P$ - angle requires norm, norm requires inner product
1. $V$ - though a hermitian form might offer a natural choice for the definition of a dual, all vector spaces have a dual space
1. $P$ - metric dual requires a metric
