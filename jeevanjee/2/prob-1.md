For each of the below, $V$ means all vector spaces, $H$ means only those with non-degenerate Hermitian forms, 
and $P$ means only those with inner products:

- $P$ - unit vector $\hat{x}$ requires the norm
- $V$ - all vector spaces can have a basis (in fact, it is possible to prove that all vector spaces have a basis)
- $V$ 
- $P$ - norm requires positive-definite form, therefore inner products
- $V$
- $H$ - orthogonality 
- $V$ - any vector space has a least the inclusion linear operator $\iota: V \xhookrightarrow{} V$ where $\iota(v) = v$ for all $v$ in $V$.
- $P$ - angle requires norm, norm requires inner product
- $V$ - though a hermitian form might offer a natural choice for the definition of a dual, all vector spaces have a dual space
- $P$ - metric dual requires a metric
