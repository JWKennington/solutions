#### Problem
Show that $\{r^l Y_m^l\}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{H}_l(\mathbb{R}^3)$, which implies that $\{Y_m^l\}$ is a basis for $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}_l$.

1. Show spherical laplacian $\Delta_{S^2} = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2 = \mathbf{L}^2$
2. Exhibit basis for $\mathcal{H_l(\mathbb{R}^2)}$ by considering function $f_0^l \equiv (x + iy)^l$ and show that $L_z(f_0^l) = lf_0^l$, $L_{+}(f_0^l)\equiv (L_x + iL_y)(f_0^l) = 0$
3. Use the definition of $Y^l_m$ to compute the spherical harmonics for $l = 1, 2$
